# Levi Kirkland GitHub Profile


The projects in my repositories include projects I am working on, and projects that help me learn new methods. I am currently learning Clean Architecture and building both a Clean version and monolithic version of the same application as a way to distinquish the principals.

Contributions are welcome. 
I am new to using GitHub so offer advice on how to accept changes into my repository. Feel free to create an issue to help me build a better app.
